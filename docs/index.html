	<h1>Hebrew Cantillation Braille encoding proposal
	</h1>

	<p>-Danny Sadinoff</p>


	<p>Goal: to give Hebrew Braille readers access to the text of the TanaCH with cantillation marks.  The main challenge here is brevity, since there exist braille readers with as few as 19 symbols, so unification is pursued where possible.
	<p>Taking my lead from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Braille">Hebrew Braille</a>, final vs medial forms are unified.
	    <p>The encoder currently has two options:
		<ul>
	    <li>Taammim encoding mode, one of CO and CP.</li>

	    <li>Dagesh mode, describing which letters take a dagesh.  Since there are standard combined forms for only four of the letters with a dagesh/mapiq, By default, Dagesh hazak is not enabled, but all of ה, בגדכפ"ת take a dagesh/mapiq.  Note that the Braille Dagesh is pre-fixed.  The two other modes are ALL for all dageshes represented and HEH_BCFT for just ה, בכפת.
		</ul>

	<h3> CO Clarity-Orthographic, dageshes removed for all but בכפת,ה</h3>
	<ol>
	    <li><a href="Exodus.10.1-11.CO.HEH_BCFT.html">Demo</a></li>
	    <li><a href="summary.CO.HEH_BCFT.html">Encoding Summary</a></li>
	    <li><a href="pangram.ashkenaz.CO.HEH_BCFT.html">Pangram</a></li>
	</ol>
	<h3> CP Clarity-Phonetic , dageshes removed for all but בכפת,ה</h3>
	<ol>
	    <li><a href="Exodus.10.1-11.CP.HEH_BCFT.html">Demo</a></li>
	    <li><a href="summary.CP.HEH_BCFT.html">Encoding Summary</a></li>
	    <li><a href="pangram.ashkenaz.CP.HEH_BCFT.html">Pangram</a></li>
	</ol>
