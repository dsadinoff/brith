Decided not to use 8-dot symbols for reverse compatability, even though

Consider the possibility of two encodings: one for clarity and one for
   brevity.

Clarity mode would be a two-character encoding:
   introducer (either high or low, or perhaps open and closed) and then
   and then a letter e.g
     * ^Z for zarka
     * _T telisha ketana 
     * ^T telisha gedola


Encoding O1 is orthographic-mode, but I think I'm going to move in a
different direction towards letters indicating the taam.



Brief mode sacrifices clarity in order to squeeze into the remaining
unallocated code points in 6-dot Hebrew.
